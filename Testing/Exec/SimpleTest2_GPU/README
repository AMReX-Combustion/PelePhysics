For this test case to run, you need to force the sparse format returned by SPARSITY_PREPROC_PRECOND to be
a "false" dense format, meaning all entries should be considered.
For this, if you are using a specific mechanism.cpp, you need to manually
modify the routines -there are two of them -  SPARSITY_PREPROC_PRECOND this way:

AMREX_GPU_HOST_DEVICE void SPARSITY_PREPROC_PRECOND(...)
{
    double ...;

    for (...) {  
        c[k] = ..;
    } 
 
    ...
    
    rowPtr[0] = 1;
    int nJdata_tmp = 1; 
    for (int l=0; ... ) {
        for (int k=0; ... ) {
            if (k == l) {
               ...
            } else {
--> comment this line //if(J[...] != 0.0) {
                    colIndx[nJdata_tmp-1] = k+1;
                    nJdata_tmp = nJdata_tmp + 1;
--> comment this line //}
            }
        }
    }

}
