# Ignition delay calculation

Compute ignition delay using a 0D reactor. Ignition delay is the time to reach initial temperature + 400K


Computation of ignition delay occurs in 2 pass

1. An estimate of the ignition delay is computed

2. The estimate is refined

## Compute ignition delay

Ignition delay will call the Pele executable find in this directory. If you have many executables, please edit `execname` in `exec_ignDelay.sh`

1. Link your mechanism in `GNUmakefile` (here using `dodecane_lu`)

2. Make sure equivalence ratio calculation is correct for you mechanism in `GPU_misc.H`

3. Adjust your parameters in `inputs/inputs.0d_firstpass`

4. Execute `bash exec_ignDelay.sh`. The result is outputted in `log`.
