C
C        ***Note*** Machine Dependent Routine
C        FDUMP is intended to be replaced by a locally written
C        version which produces a symbolic dump.  Failing this,
C        it should be replaced by a version which prints the
C        subprogram nesting list.  Note that this dump must be
C        printed on each of up to five files, as indicated by the
C        XGETUA routine.  See XSETUA and XGETUA for details.

      SUBROUTINE XERCNT (LIBRAR, SUBROU, MESSG, NERR, LEVEL, KONTRL)
C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  XERCNT
C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Allow user control over handling of errors.
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC (XERROR)
C***CATEGORY  R3C
C***TYPE      ALL (XERCNT-A)
C***KEYWORDS  ERROR, XERROR
C***AUTHOR  Jones, R. E., (SNLA)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C        Allows user control over handling of individual errors.
C        Just after each message is recorded, but before it is
C        processed any further (i.e., before it is printed or
C        a decision to abort is made), a call is made to XERCNT.
C        If the user has provided his own version of XERCNT, he
C        can then override the value of KONTROL used in processing
C        this message by redefining its value.
C        KONTRL may be set to any value from -2 to 2.
C        The meanings for KONTRL are the same as in XSETF, except
C        that the value of KONTRL changes only for this message.
C        If KONTRL is set to a value outside the range from -2 to 2,
C        it will be moved back into that range.
C
C     Description of Parameters
C
C      --Input--
C        LIBRAR - the library that the routine is in.
C        SUBROU - the subroutine that XERMSG is being called from
C        MESSG  - the first 20 characters of the error message.
C        NERR   - same as in the call to XERMSG.
C        LEVEL  - same as in the call to XERMSG.
C        KONTRL - the current value of the control flag as set
C                 by a call to XSETF.
C
C      --Output--
C        KONTRL - the new value of KONTRL.  If KONTRL is not
C                 defined, it will remain at its original value.
C                 This changed value of control affects only
C                 the current occurrence of the current message.

C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  XERMSG
C***PURPOSE  Process error messages for SLATEC and other libraries.
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC (XERROR)
C***CATEGORY  R3C
C***TYPE      ALL (XERMSG-A)
C***KEYWORDS  ERROR MESSAGE, XERROR
C***AUTHOR  Fong, Kirby, (NMFECC at LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   XERMSG processes a diagnostic message in a manner determined by the
C   value of LEVEL and the current value of the library error control
C   flag, KONTRL.  See subroutine XSETF for details.
C
C    LIBRAR   A character constant (or character variable) with the name
C             of the library.  This will be 'SLATEC' for the SLATEC
C             Common Math Library.  The error handling package is
C             general enough to be used by many libraries
C             simultaneously, so it is desirable for the routine that
C             detects and reports an error to identify the library name
C             as well as the routine name.
C
C    SUBROU   A character constant (or character variable) with the name
C             of the routine that detected the error.  Usually it is the
C             name of the routine that is calling XERMSG.  There are
C             some instances where a user callable library routine calls
C             lower level subsidiary routines where the error is
C             detected.  In such cases it may be more informative to
C             supply the name of the routine the user called rather than
C             the name of the subsidiary routine that detected the
C             error.
C
C    MESSG    A character constant (or character variable) with the text
C             of the error or warning message.  In the example below,
C             the message is a character constant that contains a
C             generic message.
C
C                   CALL XERMSG ('SLATEC', 'MMPY',
C                  *'THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX EXCEEDS THE ROW DIMENSION',
C                  *3, 1)
C
C             It is possible (and is sometimes desirable) to generate a
C             specific message--e.g., one that contains actual numeric
C             values.  Specific numeric values can be converted into
C             character strings using formatted WRITE statements into
C             character variables.  This is called standard Fortran
C             internal file I/O and is exemplified in the first three
C             lines of the following example.  You can also catenate
C             substrings of characters to construct the error message.
C             Here is an example showing the use of both writing to
C             an internal file and catenating character strings.
C
C                   CHARACTER*5 CHARN, CHARL
C                   WRITE (CHARN,10) N
C                   WRITE (CHARL,10) LDA
C                10 FORMAT(I5)
C                   CALL XERMSG ('SLATEC', 'MMPY', 'THE ORDER'//CHARN//
C                  *   ' OF THE MATRIX EXCEEDS ITS ROW DIMENSION OF'//
C                  *   CHARL, 3, 1)
C
C             There are two subtleties worth mentioning.  One is that
C             the // for character catenation is used to construct the
C             error message so that no single character constant is
C             continued to the next line.  This avoids confusion as to
C             whether there are trailing blanks at the end of the line.
C             The second is that by catenating the parts of the message
C             as an actual argument rather than encoding the entire
C             message into one large character variable, we avoid
C             having to know how long the message will be in order to
C             declare an adequate length for that large character
C             variable.  XERMSG calls XERPRN to print the message using
C             multiple lines if necessary.  If the message is very long,
C             XERPRN will break it into pieces of 72 characters (as
C             requested by XERMSG) for printing on multiple lines.
C             Also, XERMSG asks XERPRN to prefix each line with ' *  '
C             so that the total line length could be 76 characters.
C             Note also that XERPRN scans the error message backwards
C             to ignore trailing blanks.  Another feature is that
C             the substring '$$' is treated as a new line sentinel
C             by XERPRN.  If you want to construct a multiline
C             message without having to count out multiples of 72
C             characters, just use '$$' as a separator.  '$$'
C             obviously must occur within 72 characters of the
C             start of each line to have its intended effect since
C             XERPRN is asked to wrap around at 72 characters in
C             addition to looking for '$$'.
C
C    NERR     An integer value that is chosen by the library routine's
C             author.  It must be in the range -99 to 999 (three
C             printable digits).  Each distinct error should have its
C             own error number.  These error numbers should be described
C             in the machine readable documentation for the routine.
C             The error numbers need be unique only within each routine,
C             so it is reasonable for each routine to start enumerating
C             errors from 1 and proceeding to the next integer.
C
C    LEVEL    An integer value in the range 0 to 2 that indicates the
C             level (severity) of the error.  Their meanings are
C
C            -1  A warning message.  This is used if it is not clear
C                that there really is an error, but the user's attention
C                may be needed.  An attempt is made to only print this
C                message once.
C
C             0  A warning message.  This is used if it is not clear
C                that there really is an error, but the user's attention
C                may be needed.
C
C             1  A recoverable error.  This is used even if the error is
C                so serious that the routine cannot return any useful
C                answer.  If the user has told the error package to
C                return after recoverable errors, then XERMSG will
C                return to the Library routine which can then return to
C                the user's routine.  The user may also permit the error
C                package to terminate the program upon encountering a
C                recoverable error.
C
C             2  A fatal error.  XERMSG will not return to its caller
C                after it receives a fatal error.  This level should
C                hardly ever be used; it is much better to allow the
C                user a chance to recover.  An example of one of the few
C                cases in which it is permissible to declare a level 2
C                error is a reverse communication Library routine that
C                is likely to be called repeatedly until it integrates
C                across some interval.  If there is a serious error in
C                the input such that another step cannot be taken and
C                the Library routine is called again without the input
C                error having been corrected by the caller, the Library
C                routine will probably be called forever with improper
C                input.  In this case, it is reasonable to declare the
C                error to be fatal.
C
C    Each of the arguments to XERMSG is input; none will be modified by
C    XERMSG.  A routine may make multiple calls to XERMSG with warning
C    level messages; however, after a call to XERMSG with a recoverable
C    error, the routine should return to the user.  Do not try to call
C    XERMSG with a second recoverable error after the first recoverable
C    error because the error package saves the error number.  The user
C    can retrieve this error number by calling another entry point in
C    the error handling package and then clear the error number when
C    recovering from the error.  Calling XERMSG in succession causes the
C    old error number to be overwritten by the latest error number.
C    This is considered harmless for error numbers associated with
C    warning messages but must not be done for error numbers of serious
C    errors.  After a call to XERMSG with a recoverable error, the user
C    must be given a chance to call NUMXER or XERCLR to retrieve or
C    clear the error number.

C***REVISION HISTORY  (YYMMDD)
C   880101  DATE WRITTEN
C   880621  REVISED AS DIRECTED AT SLATEC CML MEETING OF FEBRUARY 1988.
C           THERE ARE TWO BASIC CHANGES.
C           1.  A NEW ROUTINE, XERPRN, IS USED INSTEAD OF XERPRT TO
C               PRINT MESSAGES.  THIS ROUTINE WILL BREAK LONG MESSAGES
C               INTO PIECES FOR PRINTING ON MULTIPLE LINES.  '$$' IS
C               ACCEPTED AS A NEW LINE SENTINEL.  A PREFIX CAN BE
C               ADDED TO EACH LINE TO BE PRINTED.  XERMSG USES EITHER
C               ' ***' OR ' *  ' AND LONG MESSAGES ARE BROKEN EVERY
C               72 CHARACTERS (AT MOST) SO THAT THE MAXIMUM LINE
C               LENGTH OUTPUT CAN NOW BE AS GREAT AS 76.
C           2.  THE TEXT OF ALL MESSAGES IS NOW IN UPPER CASE SINCE THE
C               FORTRAN STANDARD DOCUMENT DOES NOT ADMIT THE EXISTENCE
C               OF LOWER CASE.
C   880708  REVISED AFTER THE SLATEC CML MEETING OF JUNE 29 AND 30.
C           THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES ARE
C           1.  CLARIFY COMMENTS IN THE PROLOGUES
C           2.  RENAME XRPRNT TO XERPRN
C           3.  REWORK HANDLING OF '$$' IN XERPRN TO HANDLE BLANK LINES
C               SIMILAR TO THE WAY FORMAT STATEMENTS HANDLE THE /
C               CHARACTER FOR NEW RECORDS.
C   890706  REVISED WITH THE HELP OF FRED FRITSCH AND REG CLEMENS TO
C           CLEAN UP THE CODING.
C   890721  REVISED TO USE NEW FEATURE IN XERPRN TO COUNT CHARACTERS IN
C           PREFIX.
C   891013  REVISED TO CORRECT COMMENTS.
C   891214  Prologue converted to Version 4.0 format.  (WRB)
C   900510  Changed test on NERR to be -9999999 < NERR < 99999999, but
C           NERR .ne. 0, and on LEVEL to be -2 < LEVEL < 3.  Added
C           LEVEL=-1 logic, changed calls to XERSAV to XERSVE, and

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C This routine sends one or more lines to each of the (up to five)
C logical units to which error messages are to be sent.  This routine
C is called several times by XERMSG, sometimes with a single line to
C print and sometimes with a (potentially very long) message that may
C wrap around into multiple lines.
C
C PREFIX  Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This argument contains
C         characters to be put at the beginning of each line before
C         the body of the message.  No more than 16 characters of
C         PREFIX will be used.
C
C NPREF   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This argument is the number
C         of characters to use from PREFIX.  If it is negative, the
C         intrinsic function LEN is used to determine its length.  If
C         it is zero, PREFIX is not used.  If it exceeds 16 or if
C         LEN(PREFIX) exceeds 16, only the first 16 characters will be
C         used.  If NPREF is positive and the length of PREFIX is less
C         than NPREF, a copy of PREFIX extended with blanks to length
C         NPREF will be used.
C
C MESSG   Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This is the text of a
C         message to be printed.  If it is a long message, it will be
C         broken into pieces for printing on multiple lines.  Each line
C         will start with the appropriate prefix and be followed by a
C         piece of the message.  NWRAP is the number of characters per
C         piece; that is, after each NWRAP characters, we break and
C         start a new line.  In addition the characters '$$' embedded
C         in MESSG are a sentinel for a new line.  The counting of
C         characters up to NWRAP starts over for each new line.  The
C         value of NWRAP typically used by XERMSG is 72 since many
C         older error messages in the SLATEC Library are laid out to
C         rely on wrap-around every 72 characters.
C
C NWRAP   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This gives the maximum size
C         piece into which to break MESSG for printing on multiple
C         lines.  An embedded '$$' ends a line, and the count restarts
C         at the following character.  If a line break does not occur
C         on a blank (it would split a word) that word is moved to the
C         next line.  Values of NWRAP less than 16 will be treated as
C         16.  Values of NWRAP greater than 132 will be treated as 132.
C         The actual line length will be NPREF + NWRAP after NPREF has
C         been adjusted to fall between 0 and 16 and NWRAP has been
C         adjusted to fall between 16 and 132.

C           THE HANDLING OF THE NEW LINE SENTINEL TO BEHAVE LIKE THE
C           SLASH CHARACTER IN FORMAT STATEMENTS.
C   890706  REVISED WITH THE HELP OF FRED FRITSCH AND REG CLEMENS TO
C           STREAMLINE THE CODING AND FIX A BUG THAT CAUSED EXTRA BLANK
C           LINES TO BE PRINTED.
C   890721  REVISED TO ADD A NEW FEATURE.  A NEGATIVE VALUE OF NPREF
C           CAUSES LEN(PREFIX) TO BE USED AS THE LENGTH.
C   891013  REVISED TO CORRECT ERROR IN CALCULATING PREFIX LENGTH.
C   891214  Prologue converted to Version 4.0 format.  (WRB)
C   900510  Added code to break messages between words.  (RWC)

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C        XGETUA may be called to determine the unit number or numbers
C        to which error messages are being sent.
C        These unit numbers may have been set by a call to XSETUN,
C        or a call to XSETUA, or may be a default value.
C
C     Description of Parameters
C      --Output--
C        IUNIT - an array of one to five unit numbers, depending
C                on the value of N.  A value of zero refers to the
C                default unit, as defined by the I1MACH machine
C                constant routine.  Only IUNIT(1),...,IUNIT(N) are
C                defined by XGETUA.  The values of IUNIT(N+1),...,
C                IUNIT(5) are not defined (for N .LT. 5) or altered
C                in any way by XGETUA.
C        N     - the number of units to which copies of the
C                error messages are being sent.  N will be in the
C                range from 1 to 5.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Subroutines XERRWV, XSETF, XSETUN, and the two function routines
C MFLGSV and LUNSAV, as given here, constitute a simplified version of
C the SLATEC error handling package.
C Written by A. C. Hindmarsh and P. N. Brown at LLNL.
C Version of 13 April, 1989.
C This version is in single precision.
C
C All arguments are input arguments.
C
C MSG    = The message (character array).
C NMES   = The length of MSG (number of characters).
C NERR   = The error number (not used).
C LEVEL  = The error level..
C          0 or 1 means recoverable (control returns to caller).
C          2 means fatal (run is aborted--see note below).
C NI     = Number of integers (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C I1,I2  = Integers to be printed, depending on NI.
C NR     = Number of reals (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
C R1,R2  = Reals to be printed, depending on NR.
C
C Note..  this routine is machine-dependent and specialized for use
C in limited context, in the following ways..
C 1. The argument MSG is assumed to be of type CHARACTER, and
C    the message is printed with a format of (1X,80A1).
C 2. The message is assumed to take only one line.
C    Multi-line messages are generated by repeated calls.
C 3. If LEVEL = 2, control passes to the statement   STOP
C    to abort the run.  This statement may be machine-dependent.
C 4. R1 and R2 are assumed to be in single precision and are printed
C    in E21.13 format.
C
C For a different default logical unit number, change the data
C statement in function routine LUNSAV.
C For a different run-abort command, change the statement following
C statement 100 at the end.
