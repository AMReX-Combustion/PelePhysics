# WARNING: 
!! You should NOT regenerate any file for this mechanism, if you want for your code to
compile in under an hour !!

This Mechanism is so big, that compiling all the EGLIB needed routines is not recommended.
One way to deal with this issue is to break the file in several parts, and to read the necessary
EGLIB coefficients instead of having them hardcoded. These coeffs are only read once, at the
beginning of a simulation.

THIS IS WIP
