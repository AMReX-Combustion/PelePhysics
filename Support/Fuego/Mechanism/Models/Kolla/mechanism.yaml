  Mechanism for CO/H2 oxidation by Hemanth Kolla
  based on the skeletal mechanism of Evatt R. Hawkes and Ramanan Sankaran

  Only difference from skeletal mechanism is the inclusion of H2O2 and
  the reactions corresponding to its formation and consumption

  The skeletal mechanism is derived from a detailed C1 mechanism by J. Li

  Original notes on the skeletal mechanism and the detailed mechanisms follow

  Skeletal Mechanism for CO/H2 oxidation
  by Evatt R. Hawkes and Ramanan Sankaran

  Reduced from complete C1 Mechanism that is published in:

  J. Li, PhD Thesis,
  Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department,
  Princeton University, Princeton NJ.  November 2004. Thesis No. 3122-T.

  http://www.princeton.edu/~combust/database/files/symposium/C1_Mechanism.zip

  At the time of writing, a publication to IJCK is in preparation
  by the authors of the complete mechanism.

  This mechanism was reduced specifically for the purpose of the
  Direct Numerical Simulations performed in
  Hawkes, E.R., Sankaran, R., Sutherland, J.C., and Chen, J.H. (2006)
  Proc. Combust. Inst. 31, to appear.

  It was validated by comparison with the full mechanism in several cases:
  1. freely propagating premixed flames in a range of equivalence ratios,
  2. opposed-flow non-premixed flames in a range of strains up to extinction,
  3. homogeneous ignition calculations for mixtures of fuel and oxidizer streams
     and equilibrium products,
  4. two-dimensional DNS featuring extinction and local reignition.
  In all cases the agreement was excellent.

  However, the mechanism is validated ONLY for the specific conditions of the
  DNS and is not expected to be valid in general.

  The following changes (only) were made to the complete mechanism:
  1) Only the species H2 O2 O OH H2O H HO2 CO CO2 HCO N2 were retained.
     All other species and reactions involving these species were removed.  Note
     this includes all C containing species other than those essential for CO
     oxidation: CO, CO2 and HCO.  For the atmospheric pressure of the simulation,
     H2O2 was also found to be unimportant and was removed.
  2) It was found HCO has only a minor importance, and its reaction rates were
     dominated by a few key reactions.  These reactions (below) were retained
     and all others neglected.

  Steady state assumptions were investigated and found to be reasonably accurate
  for fully burning conditions but it was found they increased stiffness, hence
  they were not employed.  For reference, a steady state approximation for HCO
  and HO2 may be expected to perform reasonably well if the added stiffness can
  be tackled.  However, note the HO2 steady state assumption will degrade the
  prediction of ignition at longer ignition delay times.

  This C1 mechanism is based on the CH3OH mechanism of Held and Dryer (IJCK,1998, 30, 805)
  with following important revision:
  1.  H2/O2 subset is updated to that of Li et al. (IJCK, in press, 2004)
  2.  CO + OH = CO2 + H is optimized to fit the literature experimental result
  3.  HCO + M = H + CO + M is optimized to fit the literature experimental result
  4.  CH3 + HO2 = CH3O + OH is modified to match Scire's value at 1000 K
  5.  CH3 + HO2 = CH4 + H is taken from Scire (IJCK, 2001, 33, 75)
  6.  CH3 + O2 = CH2O + OH is taken from Scire (2002, Ph.D. thesis)
  7.  CH2O + HO2 = HCO + H2O2 is from Eiteneer et al. (JPC A. 1998, 102, 5196)
  8.  CH2O + H = HCO + H2 is from Irdam et al. (IJCK 1993, 25, 285)
  9.  CH2O + M reactions are from Friedrichs et al.(IJCK 2004, 36, 157)
  10. CH3OH decomposition reactions are taken from GRI-3.0 (1999)
  11. CH2OH + HCO = CH2O + CH2O is taken from Friedrichs et al. (IJCK, 2004, 36, 157)
  12. CH2OH + HCO = CH3OH + CO is changed to keep the branching ratio with the above reaction
  13. HCOOH reactions are not included since it is not important and has large uncertainties
  14. dHf of OH is adjusted to 8.91 kcal/mol (Ruscic et al. JPC A. 2002, 106, 2727)
  15. thermochemical data of CH2OH is fit to Johnson & Hudgens' table (JPC 1996, 100, 19874)
