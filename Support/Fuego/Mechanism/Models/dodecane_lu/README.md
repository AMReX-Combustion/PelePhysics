# Analytically Reduced Mechanisms
This mechanism is in a format that requires the use of the ckwyp.f routines to evaluate the species production rates. These should NOT be evaluated via the reactions provided in the chemkin reaction data file.
Note that if a .c file is generated at this point, it will implement the skeletal version of the reduced mechanism and it will not use the ckwyp.f routine.
