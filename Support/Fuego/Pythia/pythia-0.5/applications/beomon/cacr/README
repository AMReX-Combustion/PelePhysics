Compile nodemon and mond.
Put a copy of mond on each node you want to monitor and start it
automatically during boot.

On the front-end, Copy nodemon, monitor and xnodemon to a directory
like /usr/local/nodemon, run monitor from this directory.  Make a link
to the xnodemon script from /usr/local/bin.  monitor assumes that all
nodes you want to monitor are listed in /var/run/nodes.
