# Reduced PAH Mechanism

This reaction mechanism is 290 reactions and 47 species from Bisetti et al. (Combust. Flame 2012). This is reduced from the detailed chemical mechanism (1651 reactions, 149 species) developed by Blanquart et al. (Combust. Flame 159, 2009).
Should work for n-heptane, toluene, and ethylene fuels in premixed and nonpremixed flames. Should not be used for autoignition flames.
