===========
PelePhysics
===========

`PelePhysics` is a repository of physics databases and implementation code for use within the other `Pele` codes. In particular, the choice of chemistry and transport models as well as associated functions and capabilities are managed in `PelePhysics`.  `PelePhysics` has an official project `homepage <https://amrex-combustion.github.io/>`_, and can be obtained via
`GitHub <https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics>`_.  The documentation pages appearing here are distributed with the code in the ``Docs/sphinx`` folder as "restructured text" files.  
The html is built automatically with certain pushes to the `PelePhysics` GibHub repository.  A local version can also be built as follows ::

    cd ${PELE_PHYSICS_DIR}/build
    sphinx-build -M html ../Docs/sphinx .

where ``PELE_PHYSICS_DIR`` is the location of your clone of the `PelePhysics` repository.  To view the local pages,
point your web browser at the file ``${PELE_PHYSICS_DIR}/build/html/index.html``.
