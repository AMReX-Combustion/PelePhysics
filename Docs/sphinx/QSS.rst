Analytically reduced chemistry via quasi-steady state (QSS) assumption in `PelePhysics`
=======================================================================================

.. _sec:QSSAssumption:

The QSS assumption
------------------

Given a detailed chemical mechanism, some species can sometimes be assumed to be in a `quasi-steady state (QSS)`.
Formally, if species :math:`A` is assumed to be in a QSS then

.. math::

    \frac{\partial [A]}{\partial t} = 0,

where :math:`[A]` is the molar concentration of species :math:`A`.
If the set of QSS species is judiciously chosen, macroscopic quantities of interest such as ignition delay or laminar flame speed are only mildly affected by the QSS assumption [DRG2005]_. 

.. _sec:advantageQSS:

The advantage of the QSS assumption
-----------------------------------

Using the elementary reactions of the chemical mechanism, it is possible to write a set of algebraic equations that relate `QSS species` to `non-QSS species`. In turn, it is not necessary to transport the `QSS species` in the flow solver, as their concentration can be directly obtained from the `non-QSS species`. 

In addition, `QSS species` are typically species that induce stiffness in the chemical mechanism since they evolve on scales different that the `non-QSS species`. 

.. _sec:invertAlgebraicSystem:

From `non-QSS species` to `QSS species` concentration
-----------------------------------------------------

The set of algebraic equations that result from the QSS assumption does not always easily result in a simple algebraic relation between a given `QSS species` and all the `non-QSS species`. To do this, it is necessary to apply some form of linearization to the reactions involved [SYS2006]_. In addition, even in the presence of linear relations, `QSS species` may depend on one another. The following figure shows the relation graph between the `QSS species` of a reduced :math:`N-C_{12}H_{26}` mechanism [ND2018]_. The arrows indicate that a `QSS species` concentration depends on another `QSS species` concentration. It can also be seen that dependency groups exist among the `QSS species`. In `PelePhysics` it is possible to deduce invert analytically the linear system of equations given an arbitrary relation graph.

.. _sec:linearizing:

Linearizing the set of equations
--------------------------------

In general, the QSS assumption results in a set of equations that are non-linearly coupled making it difficult to invert the system. The non-linear relations can arise if two or more `QSS-species` are on the same side of an elementary reaction, or if the stoichiometric coefficient of a `QSS-species` is not equal to one. Below, the relation graph between the QSS species plotted above is expanded with dots that denote reactions that relate `QSS-species`. Dots or species are colored in red if they are involved in a quadratic coupling.

From here, it is necessary to eliminate the quadratic coupling to linearize the set of algebraic equations that result from the QSS assumption. Three methods can be envisioned: either one relaxes the QSS assumption by reducing the set of `QSS species` (Method 1) or one can eliminate the reactions that induce quadratic coupling. In case reactions are reversible, it can happen that either the forward or the backward reaction induces the quadratic coupling. Either one can remove both the forward and the backward reaction (Method 2) or remove either the backward or the forward reaction (Method 3).

All three methods are available in `PelePhysics`. By default, Method 3 is activated as it is computationally efficient and accurate (as will be shown below). Method 1 is the most accurate and Method 2 is the most computationally efficient in our experience. Given that each method has its advantage, we decided to allow the user to choose either one according to his/her needs.

.. _sec:validation:

Validation
----------

The three linearization methods are validated against the skeletal :math:`N-C_{12}H_{26}` [SKEL2017]_. Using 343 0D calculation that span the range of applicability of the QSS assumption (:math:`\phi = [0.5, 2.0], p=[1atm, 50atm], T=[800K, 1600K]`), the ignition delay is computed using the skeletal mechanism (SK53) and each one of the three linearization methods for the QSS mechanism (RedXX). The left plot shows the correlation between the ignition delay from the skeletal mechanism and the reduced version. The statistics of the relative error between the reduced and the skeletal mechanism are shown in the title of that plot. The right plot shows the ignition delay values at high-pressure conditions only.

Analytical Jacobian
-------------------

In several computational experiments, using analytical Jacobians was found to provide better stability or efficiency compared with finite difference approximation or numerical inversion (see also fig:qss_integrator_).
Compared with non-QSS mechanisms, analytical Jacobians need to reflect the dependence of each QSS species on non-QSS species. However, QSS species may depend on an ensemble of other non-QSS species and therefore ensemble of reactions. Therefore, analytical Jacobian cannot be constructed by sequentially adding the contribution of each reaction. This significantly complicates the analytical jacobian generation. Failure to include the dependence of QSS species with respect to non-QSS species typically results in wrong ignition profiles, unless very small timesteps are used, as seen in figure fig:qss_aj_.

To ease the implementation of analytical Jacobian in presence of QSS species, a symbolic approach is used to construct the analytical Jacobian. This strategy has the advantage of not requiring complex logic, and being flexible and readable for future development. For the last row of the Jacobian (partial difference of reaction rate with respect to temperature), finite difference is used since perturbations in temperature are less susceptible to numerical errors than perturbations in species concentrations. During the construction of the reaction rates, the operations printed to file are recorded symbolically using the ``sympy`` and ``symengine`` library [SYMPY]_. For computational efficiency during the symbolic differentiation, the chain-rules terms are computed and the final expressions are computed and assembled by chain-ruling using logic internal to `CEPTR` rather than ``sympy``. We have found that this speeds up the Jacobian construction cost by a factor 10. 

To activate the use of symbolic jacobian, one needs to pass the flag ``--qss_symbolic_jacobian`` to `CEPTR`.

Printing the Jacobian terms one by one is not possible since the expressions that include QSS species are typically very large. Instead, the expressions are reduced via common sub-expression precomputing that are later used in each term of the Jacobian. The number of subexpressions may be orders of magnitude larger than the number of Jacobian entries which can be problematic if the computational architecture has limited memory.

Several formatting strategies have been implemented to mitigate the memory footprint of the symbolic Jacobian. They can be adjusted by providing a ``.toml`` file to `CEPTR` via the ``qss_format_input`` flag. A model input file is provided in the `Tutorials` section of this documentation. A model execution script for generating a mechanism for ``dodecane_lu_qss`` is available under the `Tutorials` section of this documentation.

The formatting options are the following

.. _optimCuda: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html

* ``hformat`` **(string)**
     * ``cpu`` will print intermediate variables used for chainruling. This gives a "readable" version of the Jacobian entries, albeit memory consuming.
     * ``gpu`` will not print intermediate variables used for chainruling, and instead will replace them directly in the Jacobian entries. This gives a less readable version of the Jacobian, but more memory efficient. 
* ``remove_1`` **(boolean)** will replace expressions of the type ``1.0 * xxx`` into ``xxx``. 
* ``remove_pow`` **(boolean)** will convert expressions of the type ``pow(xxx,n)`` into multiplications or division. The conversion occurs for ``n<=3`` and ``n>=-3`` consistent with optimCuda_  
* ``remove_pow10`` **(boolean)** will convert expressions of the type ``pow(10,xxx)`` into ``exp(ln(10)*xxx)``, consistent with optimCuda_ 
* ``min_op_count`` **(integer)** counts number operations used to construct each common subexpression and replace the common subexpression if the number of operations is less or equal to ``n`` 
* ``min_op_count_all`` **(integer)** is similar to ``min_op_count`` but also counts how many times that common subexpression is used later. The meaning of ``n`` is different than for ``min_op_count`` as it refers to how many more operations will be done if the common subexpression is eliminated. This option should be prefered to ``min_op_count`` as it tends to only marginally increase the file size (therefore compile time), while still being memory efficient. 
* ``gradual_op_count`` **(boolean)** is useful if ``min_op_count`` or ``min_op_count_all`` are active. It loops from 1 to ``n`` and gradually eliminate the common subexpressions. This has the advantage of ensuring that the memory footprint is strictly monotonically decreasing as `n` is increased.
* ``store_in_jacobian`` **(boolean)** will use the Jacobian array as a temporary space to store intermediate variables. In particular, the last row of the Jacobian (dependence with respect to temperature) is done by finite difference which requires storing intermediate variables (production rate, forward and backward reactions). When the option is active, the ``productionRate`` function used to compute the finite difference is replaced with a ``productionRate_light`` functions where references to different parts of the Jacobian are used in place of allocating new arrays. 
* ``round_decimals`` **(boolean)** will round floats printed by ``sympy`` when possible to minimize character count in the ``mechanism.H`` file.
* ``recycle_cse`` **(boolean)** will reuse subexpressions that are not used later to avoid declaring new temporary reals. 
* ``remove_single_symbols_cse`` **(boolean)** will remove common subexpressions that are made of 1 operation and 1 symbol. Those common subexpressions are typically ``-xxx`` and may not appear as worth replacing because they save 1 operations and are reused multiple times. However, when replaced in the later expressions, the ``-`` operations typically disappear or is merged into another operations which actually does not increase the total number of operations. 

The analytical Jacobian for QSS mechanisms is typically more accurate and stable than GMRES, and is on par with the finite difference Jacobian of `CVODE` as seen in fig:qss_integrator_


.. _fig:qss_integrator:

     Temperature of a 0D reactor at constant pressure for NC12H26. Initial temperature is 600K, initial molar fraction of O2 is 0.7 and initial molar fraction of fuel is 0.3. Results are shown for finite difference jacobian (red thick line), analytical jacobian (black line) and GMRES (crosses) using the same tolerances.

In terms of speed, the analytical Jacobian 0D reactor is faster on CPU than finite difference Jacobian and GMRES. For the piston bowl challenge problem, the analytical Jacobian relative speed depends on the prevalence of chemical reactions. At some points, the AJ is slower than GMRES with PeleC, at others, AJ is faster. In PeleLM cases, AJ was found to be faster than GMRES. Further optimization and tests are still ongoing.


Using the Analytical Jacobian
-----------------------------

To use the analytic Jacobian QSS mechanisms in a Pele run, one must specify the correct ``solve_type``. The choice of the ``solve_type`` will determine whether or not the analytic Jacobian is used. With CUDA, both ``magma_direct`` and ``sparse_direct`` will use the analytic Jacobian, while on HIP only ``magma_direct``  will trigger the use of the analytic Jacobian parts.
