PelePhysics supports the computation of thermodynamic properties for different species. The thermodynamic property models currently supported are the NASA7 and NASA9 polynomial parameterizations. The reader is referred to the many discussions about these models to learn more specifics, including `Cantera's discussion about thermodynamics properties <https://cantera.org/science/species-thermo.html>`_.
