This directory contains various equations of state, which are selected between at compile time

GammaLaw:

   A simple gamma-law EOS.  This computes the mean molecular
   weight from the mass fractions and the species properties defined
   in the network module.  

   NOTE: this simple version of the EOS does not compute all of the
   thermodynamic variables defined in the eos_type, but only those
   needed for PeleC's execution.  

Fuego:

   A mixture of ideal gases, computed using FUEGO-generated codes.
   The specific model is selected at compile time from the list in
   ../Support/Fuego/Mechanism/Models

Soave-Redlich-Kwong:

   A cubic real-gas EOS that represents one generalization of van der Waals
   model.  With the form

       p = pid + Phi

       pid = ideal gas pressure

       Phi = departure from ideal gas
           = kTSum((Y/m)(b/(tau(tau - b)) - a/phi(tau))

Peng-Robinson:

   An alternative bubic real-gas EOS
